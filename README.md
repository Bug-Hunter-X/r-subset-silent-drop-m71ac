This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in R when subsetting data frames using character vectors.  The error lies in how R handles cases where the specified column names do not exist.  Instead of throwing an error, R silently drops the missing columns, potentially leading to incorrect results without any warning. The `bug.R` file contains code that reproduces this issue, while `bugSolution.R` offers a robust solution to prevent unexpected behavior.
